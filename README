Copy the contents of the file here, edit it to suit your folders and save.

Adapt the start and stop commands.

Make the script executable.

$ chmod 777 scprime_metadata_backup.sh

Test it. Could be you will need to sudo it.

$ ./scprime_metadata_backup.sh

Add it to the crontab of the user that owns the metadata folder. If it is root you will need to sudo it.
